# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Spendly (working title "ExpenseLY" in the README) is a lightweight personal expense tracker built with Flask and SQLite, developed incrementally as a step-by-step learning project. Route handlers and comments in `app.py`/`database/__init__.py` reference specific build steps (e.g. "Step 1 — Database Setup", "Step 3", "Step 7") — several pieces are intentionally unimplemented placeholders (plain-text responses like `"Logout — coming in Step 3"`), not bugs. Check which step is currently in progress before assuming a route or module should already be functional, and **do not implement a stub route unless the active task explicitly targets that step**.

## Architecture

```
spendly/
├── app.py              # All routes — single file, no blueprints
├── database/
│   └── db.py           # SQLite helpers: get_db(), init_db(), seed_db() — currently empty/unimplemented
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html       # Shared layout — all templates must extend this
│   └── *.html          # One template per page
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css   # Global styles (~700 lines); no per-page CSS files yet
│   └── js/
│       └── main.js     # Vanilla JS only — currently a placeholder
└── requirements.txt
```

**Where things belong:**
- New routes → `app.py` only, no blueprints
- DB logic → `database/db.py` only, never inline in routes
- New pages → new `.html` file extending `base.html`
- Page-specific styles → new `.css` file (e.g. `static/css/landing.css`), not inline `<style>` tags

## Code style

- Python: PEP 8, snake_case for all variables and functions
- Templates: Jinja2 with `url_for()` for every internal link — never hardcode URLs
- Route functions: one responsibility only — fetch data, render template, done
- DB queries: always use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders) — never f-strings in SQL
- Error handling: use `abort()` for HTTP errors, not bare `return "error string"`

## Tech constraints

- **Flask only** — no FastAPI, no Django, no other web frameworks
- **SQLite only** — no PostgreSQL, no SQLAlchemy ORM, no external DB
- **Vanilla JS only** — no React, no jQuery, no npm packages
- **No new pip packages** — work within `requirements.txt` as-is unless explicitly told otherwise
- Python 3.10+ assumed (venv here is 3.13) — f-strings and `match` statements are fine

## Subagent policy

- Always use a builtin explore subagent for codebase exploration before implementing any new feature
- Always use a subagent to verify test results after any implementation
- When asked to plan, delegate codebase research to a subagent before presenting the plan
- Always use a builtin plan subagent in plan mode

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run dev server (port 5001, not Flask's default 5000)
python app.py

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_foo.py

# Run a specific test by name
pytest -k "test_name"

# Run tests with output visible
pytest -s
```

There is no build step, linter, or frontend bundler configured — templates and static assets are served directly by Flask. No `tests/` directory exists yet.

## Implemented vs stub routes

| Route | Status |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Implemented — renders `landing.html` |
| `GET /register` | Implemented — renders `register.html` |
| `GET /login` | Implemented — renders `login.html` |
| `GET /terms` | Implemented — renders `terms.html` |
| `GET /privacy` | Implemented — renders `privacy.html` |
| `GET /logout` | Stub — Step 3 |
| `GET /profile` | Stub — Step 4 |
| `GET /expenses/add` | Stub — Step 7 |
| `GET /expenses/<id>/edit` | Stub — Step 8 |
| `GET /expenses/<id>/delete` | Stub — Step 9 |

## Warnings and things to avoid

- **Never use raw string returns for stub routes** once a step is implemented — always render a template
- **Never hardcode URLs** in templates — always use `url_for()`
- **Never put DB logic in route functions** — it belongs in `database/db.py`
- **Never install new packages** mid-feature without flagging it — keep `requirements.txt` in sync
- **Never use JS frameworks** — the frontend is intentionally vanilla
- **`database/db.py` is currently empty** — do not assume helpers exist until the step that implements them
- **FK enforcement is manual** — SQLite foreign keys are off by default; `get_db()` must run `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every connection
- The app runs on **port 5001**, not the Flask default 5000 — don't change this

## Notes

- `venv/` is present in the repo tree but gitignored — don't assume dependencies are installed globally.
- The repo has no CI config and no `.cursor`/`.github/copilot-instructions.md` rules.
